# Description

The goal for this challenge is to create a daily planner to keep track of important tasks and events. I recieved a starter code that contained the CSS stylesheet and HTML elements to help me get started with my application. I used components of the Day.js library when dealing with time and also applied what I learned about Jquery to build this aplication, so that this webpage can help end users manage their time effectively.
